Simple "if-then-else" Branching
-------------------------------

First let's take a look at a very simple function, that computes the
maximum of two integers. This is implemented using a single if control
statement.

.. literalinclude:: listings/simple_if_max.cpp
    :language: c++

Remember that in LLVM IR control-flow is implemented by jumping between
*basic blocks*, which contain instruction sequences that do not change
control flow. Each basic block ends with an instruction that changes the
control flow. The most common branching instruction is
``br`` [#brlink]_. ``br`` can be used conditionally, then it
implements a simple if-then-else, taking a boolean condition flag and
two basic block labels as parameter.

.. code-block:: llvm

    br i1 %cond, label %iftrue, label %iffalse

``br`` can also be used to unconditionally jump to a certain destination:

.. code-block:: llvm

    br label %dest

.. literalinclude:: listings/simple_if_max_cleaned.ll
    :language: llvm

In the example above, there are 4 basic blocks. The first one is the
function entry block. There space is allocated on the stack with
``alloca`` [#allocalink]_, which acts as a temporary storage for the bigger value. Then
the two paramter ``%a`` and ``%b`` are compared using the
``icmp`` instruction [#icmplink]_. The result is a boolean
(``i1``) flag, which is then used as condition for the ``br``
instruction. Then depending on the taken branch, either ``%a`` or ``%b``
is stored into the temporary ``%retval`` variable. Each of the branches
then end with a unconditional branch to the last basic block ``%end``.
There the value from ``%retval`` is loaded and returned.

You can get a graphical representation of the control-flow in the form
of a control-flow graph (CFG). This can be generated by using
``opt -dot-cfg input.ll``.

LLVM IR is a rather rich intermediate code format. So when compiling the
above snippet with higher optimization levels, LLVM will optimize the
code to use the ``select`` instruction [#selectlink]_ instead
of generating branches. The ``select`` instruction simply chooses
between two values, based on a boolean condition. This shortens the code
significantly.
